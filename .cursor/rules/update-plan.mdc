# Plan Tracking and Management

Always maintain the [PLAN.md](mdc:PLAN.md) file as the source of truth for the project implementation. Follow these guidelines:

1. After completing any task in the plan, update the corresponding checkbox from `[ ]` to `[x]` to mark it as complete.

2. If implementation decisions change or you discover a better approach than what's in the plan:
   - Update the plan to reflect the new approach
   - Add any new tasks that emerged
   - Remove or mark as obsolete any tasks that are no longer relevant
   - Add a brief comment below the changed section explaining the rationale for the change

3. Before starting any implementation work, reference the plan to ensure you're working on the next priority task.

4. If you're making substantial changes to the architectural approach, update both the plan and the relevant section in the project overview at the top of the file.

Always keep the plan document current so it accurately reflects both progress made and the evolving implementation strategy.
